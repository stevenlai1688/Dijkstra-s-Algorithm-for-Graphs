# Dijkstra-s-Algorithm-for-Graphs
barebone data structure for Dijkstra's algorithm for future use

UW Madison CS400 project.

Dijkstra's algorithm utilizes breadth-first search to create a minimum spanning tree based on the edge costs between the vertexes. In particular, this process is optimized when
we use an minimum priority heap, simplifying the average time complexity to O(V + ElogV), or O(ElogV), where E is the number of edges, and V is the number of vertices.
